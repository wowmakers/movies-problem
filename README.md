          -by Tojo Cherian(tojocherian@gmail.com)

This is solution for problem given by wowmakers as part of recruitment in programming

From a given set of imdb data as JSON it calculates average rating of each genre
Required: ruby >= 1.9.2
`$ bundle install`
`$bundle exec imdb.rb`

## Movies Problem

This repo was created as a way to apply for a programming job at WowMakers. To
apply, fork this repo and send in a pull request with the solution for the
problem. We will get in touch with you via the email provided in your github 
profile.

## The problem

In `data/movies.json`, you will find the details of some movies in JSON format.
This data includes the name, IMDB ratings and the genres of the movies (a quick
glance at the file will give you an idea about the structure of the data).

Your program should print all the genres to the terminal (in alpahabetical 
order, no repetitions) along with the average rating of movies. For example,
_Inception_ and _The Pink Panther_ are the two films belonging to the adventure
genre, so the average rating for adventure would be (8.8+5.3)/2 = 7.05.

A part of the expected output is shown here:

    ...
    7.25 Crime
    8.55 Drama
    8.50 Mystery
    ...

`sample.rb` contains the outline for this program to help you get started in
Ruby, but you could solve this in any language of your choice.

## Sending the pull request

Once you've written the program, send a pull request. We'll not be merging the
pull request, but will contact you on the email address provided in your Github
profile. It might take us a day or two to get in touch; please be patient.
